      JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of your UI components.

    <p>
      JSX is not required to use React, but it is widely used because it makes the code more readable and easier to write.

    <p>
      JSX is compiled to JavaScript at build time, which means that it is transformed into standard JavaScript function calls that create React elements.

    <p>
      JSX can also include JavaScript expressions, which allows you to dynamically render content based on the state or props of your components.

    <p>
      JSX supports embedding JavaScript expressions using curly braces, which allows you to include variables, function calls, and other expressions directly within your JSX code.

    <p>
      JSX can be used with React components, allowing you to create reusable UI elements that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces.
